# Static blog

This is a simple static page created with HTML and CSS using the CSS Grid to structure it. The main result of its creation was to learn more about CSS Grid, semantic HTML, fonts, colour codes... In addition, I became acquainted with the use of browsers tools. In the process, I had to look for free options for hosting static websites, and GitHub Pages was a very suitable option.
The purpose of the page is to have a place where I can write about things that have impressed me, taught me something or are exciting and valuable.
